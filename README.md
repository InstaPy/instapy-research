InstaPy started as a project to learn Python. This will stay one of the important aspects of this project along the development.
In this repository, we want to document some of the things we will discover, understand, and even struggle with.

Some of the topics we've already looked into are:
- [Old Instagram "internal" API](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy-Research/tree/master/old_api)
- [Publishing packages on PyPi]()
  - [Wheel distributions on PyPi]()
